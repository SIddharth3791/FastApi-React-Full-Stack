This project is a **microservice apps** using **FastAPI** for the backend, **React** for the frontend, and **RedisJSON** as the database. It utilizes **Redis Streams** as an **event bus** to facilitate real-time communication between APIs.

## ðŸ”¥ How It Works
1. **FastAPI exposes APIs** for frontend interaction.  
2. **RedisJSON stores data**, acting as a NoSQL database.  
3. **Redis Streams dispatch events** between microservices.  
4. **React communicates with FastAPI** to display real-time data.
